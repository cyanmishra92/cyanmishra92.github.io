Our paper "ResiRCA: Resilient Root Cause Analysis for Distributed Systems using Machine Learning" has been accepted at the IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) 2023. This work presents a novel approach to identifying root causes of failures in complex distributed systems using machine learning techniques.
