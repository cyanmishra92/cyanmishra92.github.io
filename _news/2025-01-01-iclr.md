I'm excited to announce that our paper "Origin: On-Device Reinforcement Learning Framework for Edge Intelligence" has been accepted at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025. This work introduces a novel framework for efficient reinforcement learning on resource-constrained edge devices.
