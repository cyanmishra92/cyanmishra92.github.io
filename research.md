# Research

My research focuses on developing sustainable and efficient machine learning systems, particularly for edge computing environments. I work at the intersection of computer architecture, machine learning, and sustainable computing to design energy-efficient systems for AI applications.

## Current Research Areas

### Sustainable Machine Learning Systems

I am developing novel techniques to reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint of machine learning systems, particularly for edge devices. This includes:

- Energy-aware neural network design and optimization
- Sustainable training and inference methodologies
- Carbon footprint measurement and reduction for ML workloads

### Hardware-Software Co-design for Edge AI

My work explores the co-design of hardware and software to optimize machine learning performance on resource-constrained edge devices:

- Custom accelerator architectures for neural network inference
- Memory hierarchy optimizations for ML workloads
- Hardware-aware neural network compression techniques

### Efficient Neural Network Inference

I research methods to make neural network inference more efficient without sacrificing accuracy:

- Model compression and quantization techniques
- Sparse neural network architectures
- Adaptive inference based on input complexity
