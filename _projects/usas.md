# Uṣa's - Sustainable Edge Computing Framework

## Overview

Uṣa's is a comprehensive framework for sustainable edge computing that optimizes energy consumption while maintaining performance requirements. Named after the Sanskrit word for "dawn," Uṣa's represents a new beginning for sustainable computing at the edge.

## Key Features

- **Energy Profiling**: Detailed energy consumption analysis of edge applications
- **Workload Characterization**: ML-based techniques to understand and predict workload patterns
- **Adaptive Resource Management**: Dynamic allocation of computing resources based on workload and energy constraints
- **Carbon-Aware Scheduling**: Optimization of task scheduling to minimize carbon footprint
- **Performance Guarantees**: Maintaining application performance while reducing energy consumption

## Technical Details

The framework consists of several components:

1. **Energy Monitor**: Hardware and software tools to measure and track energy consumption at fine granularity
2. **Workload Analyzer**: ML models to characterize and predict application behavior
3. **Resource Manager**: Intelligent allocation of computing resources based on energy and performance constraints
4. **Scheduler**: Carbon-aware task scheduling algorithms
5. **Performance Guardian**: Ensures that performance requirements are met despite energy optimizations

## Results

Our evaluations show that Uṣa's can reduce energy consumption by up to 40% while maintaining application performance within 5% of baseline. The framework has been tested on various edge devices, including Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, and custom FPGA platforms.
